## How you’ll learn


You’ll work through Bootcamp Prep on Learn.co, Flatiron School’s custom-built online platform. We promise, learning here will feel different than other online learning platforms you’ve tried. Why? It’s simple: you can’t learn real skills without real tools. Learn.co is the only learning platform that teaches programming using the same workflows and tools that professional developers use. 

* Terminal (a real development environment) 
* A Git-based workflow
* Test-Driven Development
* And, of course, lots of collaboration with other programmers

Don’t worry, we’ll help you set up everything along the way :) 

## What you’ll build

By the end of the course, you’ll already have an impressive portfolio of coding projects that you can show off when applying to coding bootcamps. How? Your code from the completed labs in Bootcamp Prep will be *automatically* added to your GitHub portfolio as you progress.

Here’s a sample of what you’ll build:
